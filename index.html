        <p>Based on this <a

                poster</a>, we decided to investigate the gender
            distribution of artists exhibited at major museums. We asked
            the question <i>"Is there a lack female representation at
                MoMA?"</i> From this, stemmed a larger question of what
            communities are over- and underrepresented at the Museum of
            Modern Art in NYC.
        </p>
        <p>To answer this, we looked at a <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/momanyc/museum-collection">Kaggle
                dataset</a>
            of all artworks exhibited by the MoMA up to approximately 2017
            accompanied by various other metadata. We were interested in
            understanding representation of different communities at the
            museum.

                <p>We start by looking at our first question: <i>"Is there
                        a lack female representation at MoMA?"</i>. We
                    provide a broad overview of the gender distribution of
                    artists at MoMA.

                <p>Here, we look to find trends in representation over
                    time. Has the MoMA <em>always</em> prefered male
                    artists? Do they still prefer male artists? We hope to
                    answer these questions by visualizing the gender
                    distribution of artworks by the year they were acquired
                    by the museum.

                <p>Now, we tackle representation from a different
                    perspective: culture, ethnicity, and nationality of
                    artists. We hope to use this as a setup to provide a
                    more nuanced and intersectional analysis of the
                    representation of different communities at MoMA

                <p> Finally, we explore representation over the different
                    categories of art exhibited in MoMA and its changes
                    over time, hoping to understand the gender distribution
                    over certain types of art, especially given our
                    understanding of the exclusion of women from artmaking
                    over many centuries.

        <p>
            After creating all of the visualizations and exploring the
            dataset we had on MoMA artwork acquisition, we have seen a
            tendency toward acquiring works of male artists more than
            female artists. We already knew that the number of works of
            male artists would be higher than the number of works of female
            artists. We have confirmed our overall bias with the bar
            charts. Later, we have also seen this trend existing overtime
            in our time-series graph. The most valuable inference from the
            time-series graph was the constant gap between male and female
            artists purchased by the museum, maintained through purchasing
            spikes, such as the reconstruction during the 1960s. These
            tendencies were an indicator of a bias toward male artists in
            MoMA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Analyzing the demographics of the artists, we were able to see
            a variety of nationalities but a vast majority were European
            and US American. Lastly, we looked at male and female artwork
            acquisition for each type of artwork and observed the disparity
            in each category, such as painting. If we had more time, it
            would be interesting to contrast artwork types with nationality
            over the years, or other intersections between our demographic
            data that allow us to have a narrower understanding of the
            communities favored by MoMA curators.
