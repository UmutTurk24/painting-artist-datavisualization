        <p>Based on this <a
                href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/guerrilla-girls-do-women-have-to-be-naked-to-get-into-the-met-museum-p78793"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Guerrilla Girls
                poster</a>, we decided to investigate the gender
            distribution of artists exhibited at major museums. We asked
            the question <i>"Is there a lack female representation at
                theMoMA?"</i> From this, stemmed a larger question of what
            communities are over- and underrepresented at the Museum of
            Modern Art in NYC.
        </p>
        <p>To answer this, we looked at a <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/momanyc/museum-collection">Kaggle
                dataset</a>
            of all artworks exhibited by the MoMA up to approximately 2017
            accompanied by various other metadata. We were interested in
            understanding representation of different communities at the
            museum.

                <p>We start by looking at our first question: <i>"Is there
                        a lack female representation at theMoMA?"</i>. We
                    provide a broad overview of the gender distribution of
                    artists at MoMA.

                <p>Second assignment focuses on seeing trends for male
                    and female representations over the years, as
                    this was easily represented with a line-graph.

                </h2>
                <p>Now, we tackle representation from a different
                    perspective: culture, ethnicity, and nationality of
                    artists. We hope to use this as a setup to provide a
                    more nuanced and intersectional analysis of the
                    representation of different communities at MoMA
