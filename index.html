        <h1>Gender Representation at MoMA</h1>
        <h2>Miguel Donado, Umut TÃ¼rk</h2>
        <p>For our semester project, we chose a dataset that contains various information on the MoMA artists from <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/momanyc/museum-collection">dataset</a>.
            We were interested in understanding representation of females in the museum. In the past two centuries,
            we have known that female representation was very low compared to male representation. However, we
            wanted to explore the gender and cultural distribution of artists exhibited at major museums, using the MoMA
            as a case study.

                    <p>This assignment contains two barcharts regarding the number of male and female artist
                        representations
                        where both graphics tell a different story regarding the disparities between the genders</p>
