        <p>For our semester project, we chose a <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/momanyc/museum-collection">dataset</a>
            that contains various information on the MoMA artists from
            Kaggle. We were interested in understanding representation of
            females in the museum. In the past two centuries, we have known
            that female representation was very low compared to male
            representation. However, we wanted to explore the gender and
            cultural distribution of artists exhibited at major museums,
            using the MoMA as a case study.

                <p>This assignment contains two barcharts regarding the
                    number of male and female artist representations where
                    both graphics tell a different story regarding the
                    disparities between the genders
