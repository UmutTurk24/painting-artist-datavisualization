        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            We initially assumed that there would be disproportionally more
            male artists exhibited. Our goal was to critically analyze our
            biases and attempt to first emphasize our assumed narrative and
            then de-emphasize it. In doing so, we not only acknowledge our
            bias but also understand the ethical implications of
            data.

            <div class="textbox">
                <p>
                    The first dataset contains every artwork exhibited at
                    the MoMA since 1929 until roughly 2020.
                    <b>Bar-Chart 1</b> shows the number of male and
                    female artists whose artwork was exhibited at MoMA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to make the difference of male and female
                    representation look larger than it already looks
                    like, we have changed the starting point of the y-axis,
                    which allowed females to look like having
                    little to no artworks in the museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nonetheless, looking at the numerical value of each
                    column, there is still a noticeable disparity between
                    the number of male and female artists. This confirms
                    our initial assumptions about inequality of
                    representation at the MoMA.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Part of this disparity could be due to artists having large
            solo exhibitions, or works that are part of a series and are
            registered as many entries in our first dataset. Although,
            arguably, this is also a form of overrepresentation, we think
            this might skew the data towards our initial bias. As such, we
            turn to our second document, a dataset of all artists ever
            exhibited, regardless of <em>how many</em> artworks were
            exhibited. We looked at this dataset in hopes of finding a more
            balanced distribution.

        <svg id="chart2"></svg>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Bar-Chart 2</h3>
        <p>
            While there are still more male artists than female
            artists, <b>Bar-Chart 2</b> shows a much less
            dramatic difference. This is so because it counts
            individual artists exhibited regardless of how
            many artworks they had shown. It is likely that solo
            exhibitions and large collections of work are
            more more common with male artists than females, which
            helps explain part of the difference between
            the two.
        </p>
        <p>
            In <b>Bar-Chart 1</b>, we shifted the lower bound of the graph
            to emphasize the small number of female artists in comparison
            to male artists. In contrast, in <b>Bar-Chart 2</b> we color
            one of the bars with a gradient in hopes of de-emphasizing the
            difference between male and female artists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite our attempt to manipulate the data, there
            is still a noticeable difference between male and female artist
            representation at MoMA.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the issues we have faced with this dataset is that we did not 
            access to the gender of the artist for each acquired artwork. This forced 
            us to exclude those artworks from the graphs. Throughout this project, we 
            were also forced to assume only two genders since the dataset did not 
            create a specifications for any non-binary genders.
